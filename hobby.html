        <p>Gardening is my hobby, I love to do gardening. At front of my reading room, I have a very small garden. I have about 20 flower plants there. I love to see my garden. Last year, I planned to make a garden and read a lot about this. One of my cousins from Delhi, helped a lot in this task. He provided me all the needed information that I need to know before start gardening.

        Finally, my father bought me a few plants and I started my garden. Now I have successfully grown a few plants here. I hope that I will increase the size of the garden. I always wanted to have a flower garden, because the flower has a very sweet smell. I have got a plan to grow a few vegetables on aside. I feel refresh when I stay in my garden. Anybody can make his own garden.  </p>

        <p>Cricket is celebrated and practiced as a sport in many countries. It is played within a 22-yard oval field with two teams competing against each other. Each team includes 11 players who can be batters, all-rounders as well as bowlers. The game starts with a toss and is played on the basis of overs where each over has 6 balls to be bowled. Runs can be scored by hitting the ball out of the boundary in the form of fours and sixes or by running between the wickets to take singles. The total number of overs depends on the format of the game.


 
        Bangladesh plays cricket both as a sport and a recreation. Youngsters can be seen with their bats and balls in every nook and corner of the country. The Bangladesh Cricket teams of both men and women represent the nation in different tournaments. The dedication and popularity of this game make it larger than life everywhere! </p>

        <p>Across the globe, thousands of games are played, and football is one of the most famous and enthusiastic game. Almost every nation has a football team, and they have a huge fan following. There are many football tournaments held on national as well as international levels. We can judge how famous the game is by seeing the crowdâ€™s enthusiasm and craze watching a match of their favorite team playing. It is believed that the game was invented in England around the mid-19th century, but there exists controversy as the Chinese claim that they had invented the game.

        There is a set of rules that a player and the team as a whole have to maintain while playing football, and the International Football Association Board formulates these rules. FIFA or Federation Internationale de Football Association organizes a football world cup every four years, and there is one of the biggest and most eagerly awaited football game.</p>
